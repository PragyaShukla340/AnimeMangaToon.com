## Hypothetical Data Generation

For this project, I generated a hypothetical dataset to simulate real-world scenarios. This synthetic data was created to demonstrate the functionality and capabilities of the analysis methods implemented in the project.

## Features

- [Review the article “Why is the Tower of God Show So Popular?” and imagine it has user data
such as page views, average time spent, and bounce rate.]
 Analyze these metrics and create visualizations (bar graphs, pie charts) to identify engagement trends.
 Suggest two strategies to increase the average time spent on the page based on your analysis.

- [Use “11 Best Solo Leveling Arcs in the Manhwa to Read Now” as a case study.]
  Develop a report that outlines user segmentation based on demographics or behavior (e.g., age group,returning vs. new visitors) and 
  suggest ways to tailor content for these segments.

## Technologies Used

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
